# CNN Autoencoder
This is a simple project building a CNN autoencoder using pytorch and CIFAR10 data set. I have highly relyed on [this article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/convolutional-autoencoder) helping me to have a reference thus understanding practically how an autoencoder is built.

## Lessons Learned

Building this autoencoder helped me understand their under the hood workings and how images can be generated using using them, which form a base for understanding further advanced topics like diffusion, GANs. This also helped me understand Convolution layers in general.
Further, this opened many paths for me to lead a project using autoencoders for instance CNN autoencoders being used in anomaly detection, general autoencoders used in data compressions and so on..
